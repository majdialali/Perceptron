In this project, I have  built Perseptron model from scratch by my own.
functions: generating random weigts as a start..calculating the z-value (X*W+b) for given X...fitting methods which tar X_train and y_train..the last function is for predicting a single input (X_test).
I tested this model using a radom data set generated by sklearn, Another test invented by me where 
I image the confilct between good and evil. An my training data were biased to good, of cource. :)
